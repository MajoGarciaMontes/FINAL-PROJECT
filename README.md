# Project Proposal "Breast cancer prediction model"

Team members: María José García, Roberto Barrón, Luis Paul Garay and Daniel Murillo

## Project description/outline: 
Machine learning model aimed to learn through several breast cancer variables in order to predict the probability of developing breast cancer.                    

## Questions to answer with the model:  
- What classification fits the patient? (benign / malignant tumor). 
- What is the accuracy of the classification?

## Data for the project

According to the National Cancer Institute, ‘a woman born today has about a 1 in 8 chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer at some time during her life’. That is a very high chance! Therefore, we must have better models that predict breast cancer at an early stage. For this project, the team decided to work on improving the screening for breast cancer with Machine Learning models. Breast cancer is a disease that can significantly impact the lives of many women and can be deadly if not detected and treated early. Moreover, the costs of having more advanced tests done in order to determine whether a tumor is benign or malignant can go up exponentially, which means that not every patient will be able to have them done.
Hence, we want to develop an app that doctors can easily use to input specific patient data, and the app will classify the patient's tumor into one of two categories: ‘benign’ or ‘malignant’. This app will be trained with intelligent models and fed data of correct previously made diagnoses. It will be accurate and precise, and it could be a great option for doctors to use before prescribing patients more expensive tests that the latter might not be able to afford.

### - ETL: 
    1. Data cleansing of the original dataset.
    2. Database creation (SQL).

### - Creation of the API (Python & Flask).
### - Dashboard coding (JavaScript).
### - Machine Learning --> Train Model.
