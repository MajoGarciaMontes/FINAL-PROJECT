# Project Proposal "Breast cancer prediction model"

Team members: María José García, Roberto Barrón, Luis Paul Garay and Daniel Murillo

## Project description/outline: 
Machine learning model aimed to learn through several breast cancer variables in order to predict the probability of develop breast cancer.                    

## Questions to answer with the model:  
- What classification fits the patient? (Cancer / Healthy). 
- What is the accuracy of the classification?

## Data for the project

According to the National Cancer Institute, ‘a woman born today has about a 1 in 8 chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer at some time during her life’. That is a very high chance! Therefore, we must have better models that predict breast cancer at an early stage.For this project, the team decided to work with something related to the health sector, specifically focusing on breast cancer. Breast cancer is a disease that can significantly impact the lives of many women and can be deadly if not detected and treated early. 
We would like to develop an app that doctors can easily use to input specific patient data, and the app classifies the patient into one of two categories: ‘cancer’ or ‘healthy’.
